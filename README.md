____________________________________________________________________________
 
This project offers a detailed overview of the 1775 census demographics of Charlestown, exploring the neighborhood's vibrant community prior to the Battle of Bunker Hill. By examining data on family structures, individual residents, and enslaved people, the data aim to uncover significant historical sites that tell unique stories. This analysis is intended to support further in-depth study and assist archaeological teams.

Additionally, this project seeks to compare the socio-economic dynamics of Charlestown in 1775 with its present-day conditions. Through this comparative approach, we enhance our understanding of the area's historical and cultural evolution, providing valuable insights into how Charlestown has transformed over the centuries.

The overview is presented in the form of visualizations that describe the data of Charlestown in 1775 to Charlestown today.
